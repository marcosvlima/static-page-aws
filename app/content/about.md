## Who writes

Hi there, I'm Marcos Vinicius de Moura Lima,
 
I have a degree in Computer Science and over 10 years of experience in systems engineering. My skills encompass backend development and infrastructure. My main focus is fostering a culture of collaboration among teams and finding solutions to problems using DevOps/SRE tools and methodologies.

I have experience in DevOps, platform engineering, SRE Cloud, and security, which gives me a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle. I believe in the importance of ensuring the quality, scalability, and reliability of systems while optimizing processes and promoting operational efficiency.

Currently, I am pursuing a postgraduate specialization program to further enhance my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and practices.

In addition to my work, I have an interest in research and constantly explore new technologies and concepts. Additionally, among my hobbies are computer RPG games, aerospace engineering, astronomy, and mathematics.
